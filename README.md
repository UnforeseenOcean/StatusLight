# StatusLight
Simple ESP8266 project to turn beacon lights into status lights

This project is based on the ESP8266 Web GPIO example from https://lastminuteengineers.com/creating-esp8266-web-server-arduino-ide/

The circuit is dead simple, so anyone with some electronics knowledge should be able to modify it.
